In this module, we need to construct template files and labeling the data with BNI.
Moreover, we split word into chinese characters, labeling each character with MESB.
We need to extract < someplace at city >, 'city' and 'at' are determined by the given context,
thus any words classified as MESB would be filled in the triple as the first entity.
